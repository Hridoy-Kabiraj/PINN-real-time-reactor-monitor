# PINN-real-time-reactor-monitor
In this project, I do real-time monitoring using PINN for changes in control rod position in the PUR-1 reactor.

I collected all the data from https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/PHYSICS-INFORMED_NEURAL_NETWORK_SOLUTION_OF_POINT_KINETICS_EQUATIONS_FOR_PUR-1_DIGITAL_TWIN/21648407?file=38403104. 

To validate my model, I set up a demo control rod using Arduino Uno.
